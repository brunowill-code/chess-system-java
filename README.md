# Chess System in Java

This project is a chess game implementation in Java.  
It is primarily a learning project where I study and practice Java fundamentals such as object-oriented programming, inheritance, method overriding, and other core concepts.

## Project Purpose

- Learn Java syntax and best practices  
- Understand and apply OOP principles  
- Practice method overriding and polymorphism  
- Build a basic chess game logic from scratch

## Features

- Basic chessboard setup with pieces  
- Movement logic for each piece  
- Capture mechanics  
- Check and checkmate detection (work in progress)  
- Console-based interaction (no GUI yet)

## Technologies Used

- Java (latest stable version)  
- Object-Oriented Programming concepts  
- Custom classes for chess pieces and board management  

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Compile the Java files (`javac *.java`)  
3. Run the main class (`java Main` or the main class you have)  

## What Iâ€™m Learning

- Java classes, inheritance, and interfaces  
- Method overriding and polymorphism  
- Exception handling and input validation  
- Basic algorithms and game logic
